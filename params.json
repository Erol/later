{"name":"Later","body":"# Later\r\n\r\n[**Later**](erol.github.com/later) is a lightweight Redis-backed event scheduling library for Ruby.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nLater allows you to set an event with unique names on a schedule and run it in the future:\r\n\r\n    require 'later'\r\n\r\n    Later[:reservations].set 'event-1', Time.now + 60\r\n    Later[:reservations].set 'event-2', Time.now + 120\r\n    Later[:reservations].set 'event-3', Time.now + 180\r\n\r\nRescheduling an event is simple:\r\n\r\n    Later[:reservations].set 'event-1', Time.now + 240\r\n\r\nAnd an event can also be unset:\r\n\r\n    Later[key].unset 'event-1'\r\n\r\nYou can manage multiple schedules using different keys:\r\n\r\n    Later[:reservations]\r\n    Later[:appointments]\r\n\r\nThe schedules are stored on the default Redis instance. If you need a schedule which must reside on a different Redis instance, you can pass a [Nest](github.com/soveran/nest) object when referencing a schedule set.\r\n\r\n    redis = Redis.new host: host, port: port\r\n    key = Nest.new :reservations, redis\r\n\r\n    Later[key]\r\n\r\n### Workers\r\n\r\nWorkers are Ruby processes that run forever. They allow you to process event schedules in the background:\r\n\r\n    require 'later'\r\n\r\n    Later[:reservations].each do |event|\r\n      # Do something with the event.\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # This line is never reached.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason, a worker has to stop itself from running:\r\n\r\n    Later[:reservations].each do |event|\r\n      # Do something with the event.\r\n\r\n      Later[:reservations].stop if stop?\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    # This line is reached if stop? is true.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'later'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install later\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
